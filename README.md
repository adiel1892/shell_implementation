In this task we implementing a linux shell.
we implement the methods:
dir , cd , copy file , delete file , tcp port , local , echo , exit.
We also used system and execvp.

# Work with the program 
- download the zip file.
- run ./mains
- run ./server (to open the server)

# The commands
When you will run the program a "yes master?" question will come.
- ECHO something
- DIR
- To move to the server insert - TCP PORT
- To exit from the server insert - LOCAL
- CD
- To copy a file insert - COPY SRC DEST
- To Delete a file insert - DELETE filename
- To exit insert - EXIT

If you will insert a command that we didn't implement it will go straight to the execvp command.
The answers for the question is in comments in the code.
